- While you might hear people talking about car parts "rusting," it's actually more accurate to say they're corroding.
	- You can't stop rust, but you can slow it down.
	- Since nothing lasts forever, you can't expect perfection but you can mitigate damage. 

## TLDR, why does car rust happen?
- Steel is an alloy of iron, carbon, and other elements. 
- Oxygen and water slowly steal iron atoms from the steel components of your car
	- Rain,Puddles,Snow,Salt all accelerate this change in chemistry 
- Rust prevention may be necessary if you live anywhere with high volumes of snow and rain. 
	- If your roads are salted regularly, this will rust your car quicker
		- Saltwater acts like a conductor, allowing electricity to flow between the metal and the salty goo. This speeds up the natural process of metal losing electrons, which is the first step in rusting.
- Rinsing the salt off and applying undercarriage coatings helps slow rust down

## Where does Rust like to build?
- **Frame:** The core structural support of the car, often made of high-strength steel for rigidity and safety.
- **Suspension components:** Arms, control rods, and various brackets involved in the suspension system are typically made of steel for their load-bearing capabilities.
- **Exhaust system:** Pipes and mufflers are often constructed from steel due to their need to withstand high temperatures and stresses.
- **Drivetrain components:** Driveshafts, axles, and differential housings might be made of steel for their strength and ability to handle torque.

## What does an undercoat accomplish?
- It will stop the chemical reaction from occuring so quickly
- Generally most popular options are oil based to displace oxygen and moisture
## How often do I need to undercoat my car?
- This is largely based on locale 
- It is a mandatory preventative maintenance if you live in the salt/rust belt.

## What are the popular options out there?
### Fluid Film
- Can wash off, due to this you need to re-apply regularly
- Good idea always to clean the undercarriage first and then apply
- Good to apply during fall before the rainy/winter season
- Avoid undercarriage washes until thawed spring/summer

### ~Surface Shield

### Cosmoline
https://www.cosmolinedirect.com/cosmoline-black-rust-veto-344/
 - A much heavier duty product
 - Needs rust prep before applying
 - Allows pressure washing underneath after applying
### Grease
- Grease can also work
## What are Bad Options?:

- This might be a good option for new/unrusted cars but it seems terrible to work on or repair serviceable parts or even remove after the fact
- If there is already rust present, it will probably not prevent the corrosion from accelerating due to trapped moisture/salts/etc. This won't lock moisture out, but lock it in. 

## ~What are they made out of?
- Many are lanolin based. 
## How Well Do they Protect?
- Better than an untreated vehicle!

### Comparisons

## How often should I do it?
- Reddit user @ninjadude4535 states:
> In my own experience doing corrosion control on aircraft, fluid film is always the default go-to for prevention as it is a much more refined product that can handle much more abuse before it wears away to the point it is no longer effective. As long as you keep up with a reapplication schedule appropriate for your climate and driving conditions, it is absolutely worth the premium in my opinion. If you don't see yourself maintaining a solid upkeep schedule, it won't be worth the up front cost if you're just going to let it fade away and allow corrosion to set in.

## What does a professional service entail?

### Rust Prep
- Some shops offer services to brush off any surface level rust prior to applying undercoat
- Some higher end options are [C02 blasting](https://www.hagerty.com/media/maintenance-and-tech/dry-ice-cleaning-the-coolest-way-to-remove-rust-grime-and-undercoating/)

### Thorough Spraying:
- They can get into the more obscure and tight areas in the body to prevent rust often where it begins first
### Drilling beware
- Often times they will drill access holes into your rocker panels
- Sometimes this is a point of contention if you already have methods of accessing the interior of the panels already and don't want additional drilling.

> You can go as basic as buying a 3 can aerosol spray set for $30 and going to town yourself. $30 with some jackstands and some time. You'll probably get 90% of the effectiveness a $200-300 "professional" is going to do.
- Youtube @bradboustead1682 states:
>Tip for the DIY guys doing this laying on your back in the driveway: Park your car on a big sheet of plastic. Raise your car up on 4 good jack stands. Tape a plastic skirt around the sides. Weight down the bottom edge of the plastic skirt. Put a fan at one end to draw air through the tunnel you created. Wear a hoodie, old clothes, and some sort of face cover.
### Necessary Equipment
- Driveway/Car Port/Area to work on car safely
- - Nitrile Gloves
- Large Wire brush to remove loose rust deposits
- Respirator and Protective Clothing
- Fluid Film Undercoating Spray Gun or 5-6 Cans with adapters for First Coat
	- Air Compressor if using Spray Gun

>What you're really paying for is the guy's time, lift, and equipment like an air compressor sprayer. If you don't want to get down there yourself, that's the option.
>
>You do need to reapply it yearly, usually in the fall, if you're using the car daily. For a car that's not driven a lot and perhaps not at all in winter or rain, it should last 2-3 years or more. Point is, it's not just $275 said and done... it's $275 yearly. Which if I can get 90% of the coverage DIYing for $30 yearly, I'm choosing that.


- Reddit User @Benedlr states:
> The $200 job is for the underside. The $275 FF application sprays inside all body panels too. Rattle cans are lighter bodied in order to spray. A gallon can is denser and you have a choice of frame black or clear. FF has prevented further rusting on my '08. The spray has kicked WD40 to the curb. It's all I use because it works.
