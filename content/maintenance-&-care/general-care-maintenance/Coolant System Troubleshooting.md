# Old Coolant Flush:
[DIY: Coolant/Antifreeze Change | Honda Element Owners Club](https://www.elementownersclub.com/threads/diy-coolant-antifreeze-change.29313/)
- Some contention on whether to do the distilled water flush but the idea is to drain using the petcock, clean the reservoir of any sediment, fill radiator via cap, fill reservoir to max, and then burp the coolant (remove air) via the correct list of steps below. After this, drive it around a bit and monitor the temp gauge and top off more if levels change and be wary of any leaks. 

## Steps

Don't forget to turn the heat on HIGH and let the coolant flush through the system while idling  and pushing air bubble out. They tend to get trapped on the high points, like the heating system.

#Note He has more vids on power steering and transmission fluid draining/refilling

# Simple Considerations:
- OEM radiator cap check (stick to OEM)
- Remove Air Bubbles from radiator (run with cap off) and carefully rev. It any comes out, radiator fluid is flowing
	- Check temp gauges as well during this process
- Check Relays & Fuses

# When to do a coolant flush
Check the service history or do it when you buy a used car if not sure and then every 60k miles.
