# Spool Valve Assembly
The Honda Element spool valve assembly, also known as the VTEC solenoid assembly, is a component of the engine that controls the Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system.

Here's a breakdown of its function:

* **VTEC system:** This system adjusts the timing and lift of the engine valves for optimal performance and fuel efficiency at different engine speeds.
* **Spool valve assembly:** This component acts like a switch, regulating the oil pressure sent to the VTEC actuator. By controlling the oil pressure, the spool valve assembly determines whether VTEC is engaged or not.

In simpler terms, the spool valve assembly is like a conductor in an orchestra, directing the VTEC system to adjust the engine valves based on driving conditions.

Here's some additional information you might find helpful:

* **Part number:** The common part number for the Honda Element spool valve assembly is 15810-RAA-A03.
* **Replacement:** If your Element is experiencing VTEC-related problems (identified by trouble codes like P2646 or P2647), replacing the spool valve assembly might be necessary.
* **Location:** The spool valve assembly is typically located inside the engine bay, behind the engine on the passenger side.
