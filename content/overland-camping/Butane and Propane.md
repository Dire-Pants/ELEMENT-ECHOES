The main differences between propane and butane lie in their chemical properties and how they perform as fuel:

* **Boiling point:** Butane has a lower boiling point (around 31째F)  compared to propane (-44째F). This means butane can become less effective in cold weather because it struggles to vaporize from the liquid state into a gas, which is necessary for combustion. Propane performs well in both cold and hot conditions.

* **Pressure:** Propane canisters store fuel at a higher pressure than butane canisters. This allows propane stoves to deliver a more consistent and powerful flame.

* **Burn time:** Due to the higher BTU content of propane (around 21,500 BTU/pound vs. roughly 19,800 BTU/pound for butane) and the ability to maintain a consistent pressure, propane generally offers a longer burn time than butane canisters, especially at high heat.

* **Availability:** Propane canisters are more widely available than butane canisters, especially in remote areas.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature                 | Propane                     | Butane                        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Boiling Point           | -44째F                        | 31째F                           |
| Pressure                 | Higher                        | Lower                          |
| Flame Consistency        | More consistent              | Less consistent at low temp.   |
| Burn Time (per BTU)     | Longer                        | Shorter                         |
| Availability             | More widely available        | Less widely available          |

In conclusion, propane is the better choice for most campers due to its wider availability, better performance in cold weather, and longer burn time. Butane can be a good option for ultralight backpackers prioritizing weight and size, especially for summer camping in non-windy conditions.
