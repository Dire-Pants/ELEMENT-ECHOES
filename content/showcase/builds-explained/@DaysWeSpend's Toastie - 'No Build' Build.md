# Refined Modification List:
I was going to do a write-up about all the parts needed for this really practical and minimally difficult build but these two were awesome enough to do that for us:

## Cheaper Mattress Solution:

- This shows an arrangement that allows two more passengers
- If you stick with the dunnage rack sizing that DaysWeSpend details, then you'll have an "11-inch" gap in the middle
- You can buy two of these pre-made mattresses and save money on custom upholstery
- You also get a couple more inches of lift from thicker foam
- These mattresses also stick out further and can sit over the seats when they're pulled back giving you a little more leg

## Opinions
 ### Notable Pros
 - This is a great first start and has many great considerations for beginner adventurer / micro-campers
 ### Potential Cons
- Their water system shown gets the job done but I feel like I personally would like some kind of external option that could double as an outdoor shower.
	- #task Need to look into mountable water and fuel tank options
