# Personal Issue Overview
- Engine couldn't handle steep grades and would buck in fourth gear. Would lose power temporarily going from 70mph to 60mph VTEC solenoid/spool valve assembly replaced. [This error code was also shown by Jiffy Lube](https://www.elementownersclub.com/threads/p2646-rocker-arm-actuator-control-system-performance-stuck-off-all-fixes-didnt-work.163404/)
- The driver side motor/regulator broke and the window fell into the door. Had to DIY repair this with a replacement part. The right window switch isn't working great either. 
- After Idaho trip Noticed the coolant temp bouncing and remaining on high 
	- Barely finished the trip and let it cool down
	- Didn't press luck, noticed leaking radiator coolant
	- Filled coolant while not running a bit over the MAX line which may have not been correct 
	- Noticed the coolant was running out from the car the reservoir went from past max to empty after not driving it for 5 days
	- Don't have a good workspace to work on car in the random Portland weather and at current home so I took it to Ron Tonkin honda
		- Leaky hose replaced
