# Trace Template Outline
- Use a paper that works well (something slightly firm yet malleable like butcher paper)
* Use a Paper Scoring Tool (not an exacto knife!) for an accurate outline
	* Alternatively, use a sharpiet to get the paper outline and trace slightly bigger onto cardboard

# Cut Reflectix
- Use templates and cut reflectix with an exacto knife on a proper cutting surface

# Blackout Back Side
- Either sew/switch a black fabric (canvas?) on one end
- Alternatively, use Gorilla All Weather Tape
