* 2 inch lift showcased
* HRG Subframe and Engine Drop Kit
* Tips
	* Retorque the bolts of the subframe for this installation after a few weeks as bolts stretch
	* The tire rod will hit the frame when the car is lifted, some cutting to the frame is needed to provide clearance for the tire rod
		* It is a good idea to add rust protection to the metal that was cut
	* HRG Kit comes with some spacers for evap box
		* Video claims they aren't really necessary
		* May be necessary for a higher lift.
	* Anything above two inches may start to stretch the emergency break line
		* They mention it can be left loose to and unmounted to prevent issues
* Cons
	* When lifting an element you are going to experience axel vibrations
		* For this, a subframe & engine drop kit is recommended to reduce the vibration
		* If the drop kit isn't used, vibrations will be considerable
		* This is also recommended for even a one inch lift
