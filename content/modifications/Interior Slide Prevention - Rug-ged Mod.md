[Rugged Element (because I added a rug) : r/HondaElement](https://www.reddit.com/r/HondaElement/comments/1aqdng3/rugged_element_because_i_added_a_rug/)

While the flooring in the Element is very easy to clean, it's smooth surface often allows items to slide around. It is not a good feeling to have the seats up and removed and have items move around and bang into your walls. 

This modification primarily helps prevent sliding but can be used as another protective layer on top to keep things cleaner. 

The reddit user here makes mention of using a 48” x 72” floor mat with a rubberized bottom, and cutting it to fit. They used a contouring tool to get the precise curves of the interior cut out of the mat.
