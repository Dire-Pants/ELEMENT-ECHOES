The Element did not change significantly during production from 2003 through 2011.   As a result, it can be challenging to identify the differences between various trim levels, standard options and configurations. Here is a basic primer to help clarify the features and specifications.

Honda grouped features in several trim levels. Generally, across all years the trim differences were:

- DX - Entry level vehicle, steel wheels, minimal features
- LX - Midline vehicle, steel wheels, some features
- EX - Highline vehicle, all available features including map lights, better stereo, alloy wheels and additional controls, power outlets and aux input to stereo.
- SC - Highline vehicle optimized for street/handling with a lower stance and unique colors for exterior and interior

Note the moonroof used to access the sleeping area of the camper was stock only on AWD/4WD versions from 2003 to 2008

2003:

- DX - AC & stereo optional!

All versions feature redesigned dash board with much easier to read gauges, seat belts mounted in the front seats and increased safety systems such as additional air bags, and stability assist.
